# 🌦️ Weather Trends Visualizer 

## 📌 Introduction
Weather data analysis is an important task in data science and analytics. 
Understanding temperature patterns and trends can help in climate research, 
agriculture planning, disaster management, and energy usage optimization.

This project demonstrates how to process, analyze, and visualize weather data using Python. 
It focuses on daily temperature trends for 30 days in July 2025.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. To load and clean weather data from a CSV file.
2. To visualize the data using line and bar charts.
3. To analyze patterns, peaks, and dips in daily temperatures.
4. To prepare insights that can be used for decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains **30 rows**, representing daily temperatures of July 2025.
- Columns:
  - **Date**: Represents the day (YYYY-MM-DD format).
  - **Temperature**: Daily maximum temperature in °C.

Example:
```
Date,Temperature
2025-07-01,34
2025-07-02,33
2025-07-03,36
...
```

## 🔧 Methodology
1. **Data Loading**
   - Used Pandas to read the CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted 'Date' column to datetime format.
   - Ensured 'Temperature' column is numeric.
   - Removed any missing/invalid values.
3. **Visualization**
   - Generated a **line chart** to show the daily trend.
   - Generated a **bar chart** for comparative daily visualization.
   - Saved charts as PNG for reporting.

Pipeline:
```
CSV Input → Data Cleaning → Visualization → Insights
```

---

## 📊 Results
- The daily temperature fluctuated between **28°C and 40°C**.
- Line chart shows clear warming trends and cooling dips.
- Bar chart helps identify highest and lowest days visually.

Charts generated:
1. **temperature_trend.png** (line chart)
2. **temperature_bar.png** (bar chart)

---

## 📝 Insights
- Peak temperatures were observed mid-month, indicating a heatwave trend.
- Several dips suggested cooler days, likely due to rainfall or cloudy weather.
- Visualization provides easy-to-understand climate patterns.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
- Successfully demonstrated data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization.
- Clear insights were extracted from a simple dataset.
- Visualization proved useful for interpreting climate patterns.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add more features like humidity, rainfall, and wind speed.
- Extend dataset to cover yearly or multi-year weather data.
- Integrate ML models to forecast future weather patterns.
